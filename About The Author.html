  <p align="left">My name is Dylan I am 15 and i decided to start up this page because I enjoy making people laugh. I plan on updating this site about once a week with fresh memes. Visit the poll to vote on what you would like to see in the future and i will include them in the next upload, if you guys have any other suggestions about what I should do with the page feel fre to include that in the poll's comment box. later on I may try to add a chat for all of the users to communicate with eachother. Let me know in the comments if that is something you would like to see, you can also contact me at <a href="mailto:dylanfrantz17@gmail.com">dylanfrantz17@gmail.com</a> for any other inquiries.</p>
